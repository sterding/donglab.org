Our lab currently moved to Yale after staying in Brigham and Women's Hospital / Harvard Medical School for ten years. We are now a core part of the new Stephen and Denise Adams Center for Parkinson's Disease Research at Yale, affiliated with the Yale School of Medicineâ€™s Department of Neurology and Section of Biomedical Informatics and Data Science (BIDS). We are geographically located at the 100 College Street and 300 George St in New Haven, Connecticut. From 2025, we will move to the new building of 101 College St.
