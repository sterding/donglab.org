Maoxuan was a postdoctoral fellow in Dong Lab at the Department of Neurology at BWH and Harvard Medical School. Maoxuan was a former radiologist, and he earned his medical degree from China Medical University, Shenyang, China. He switched his career from radiology to bioinformatics impressed by the great translational capability of bioinformatics and its significant benefits for human health. He received his Master and Doctorate degrees in Bioinformatics and Genomics from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte and had worked on human cardiovascular genomics at the University of Michigan, on the human oral microbiome at the Forsyth Institute, and on human cancer genomics and epigenomics at MGH Cancer Center. Maoxuanâ€™s work in Dong Lab will focus on integrating single-cell multi-omics data (e.g. single-cell RNAseq, ATAC-seq) to characterize human neurological diseases. In his spare time, he enjoys spending time with his family, reading, hiking, running, skiing, and watching NBA.
