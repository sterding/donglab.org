Jiale Yu is currently a master’s student in Computer Engineering at Columbia University, focusing on machine learning and multimodal data integration for healthcare and human activity recognition. Before joining Columbia, he conducted research at Auburn University under Professor Mao, where he developed machine learning models for RFID denoising and diffusion-based signal generation, addressing the challenge of limited real-world data through simulation-driven training pipelines. He has extensive experience in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and large-scale signal analysis, enabling efficient model training and evaluation across diverse datasets. Beyond technical development, Jiale has actively contributed to the open-source community in Rust, Python, and TypeScript, and strives to integrate computational intelligence into practical applications in healthcare and bioinformatics.
