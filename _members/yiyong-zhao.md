Yiyong "Rambo" is a post-doctoral research fellow currently advancing his studies in Dr. Dongâ€™s lab. His current research interests focus on revealing the unknown functions of the human genome and their roles in neurological diseases by applying and developing computational methods to integrate multi-dimensional multi-source data. Yiyong received his Ph.D. in bioinformatics from Fudan University China (2016-2021 and completed the Ph.D. joint program at Pennsylvania State University in the United States (2019-2020). His main work was related to evolutionary genomics and comparative genomics during his Ph.D. training (Nature 2020, Mol. Plant 2021.). Before joining the Lab, Yiyong worked as a bioinformatics and artificial intelligence scientist at Drug Farm, a pioneer company to utilize genetics and AI technologies to discover and develop innovative, immune-modulating therapies in Shanghai (2020-2021). Afterward, he worked as a professor in crop genetics and breeding at Guizhou University, China, in 2022. He likes hiking and playing soccer in his spare time.
