My name is Deep Patel and I graduated from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Jodhpur with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering in May 2024. Currently, I'm a first year Master's student in the Computational Biology and Bioinformatics program at Yale.
My major interest lies in understanding the nature of jumping genes (Alu element) and how they are responsible for regulating gene expression with the help of long non-coding RNAs. I'm amazed by the fact that how an Alu insertion can lead to eredication of the tail from the human, there are several other events which may be impacted by Alu but still haven't understood.
Even I like to build tools for the visualization of genomic data. I developed a tool "Colosseum Chart" which helps to visualize the genomic data across various time points.
In addition to this, I like to go for Hiking and watch sci-fi movies in my spare time.
