Dr Mingming Lu is currently a postdoctoral research fellow in Dong Lab. She obtained her Ph.D. in Bioinformatics from the Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Science, and China National Center for Bioinformation in January 2023. Her research primarily focuses on integrating multi-omics data, including genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics, to study human complex traits and diseases, dissect gene regulatory mechanisms, and identify and characterize key causal genes for diseases. Now, her main research interest lies in multi-omics analysis of neurological disorders and deciphering key gene regulatory mechanisms at single-cell level in Parkinson's disease.
