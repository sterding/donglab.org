Sophia Kong is currently a high school intern in Dong Lab, where she focuses drug repurposing for neurological disorders. She is a student at the Peddie School, where she has developed a keen interest in the biological sciences through coursework in biology and chemistry, as well as in computational methods through programming in Java, Python and R. In the lab, Sophia is involved in data-driven research to identify potential therapeutic uses for existing drugs, with a particular interest in the biological mechanisms underlying disease. Outside of the lab, Sophia enjoys dancing and playing the violin. Looking ahead, Sophia plans to pursue studies in biology or a related scientific field in college, with the goal of continuing her exploration of how research and technology can be used to improve human health.
