Jie completed his PhD in computer science at Columbia University working on statistical tools for GWAS analysis, including methods to identify disease subtypes with unique SNP associations (Yuan et al. Nature Genetics, 2018; Yuan et al. PLoS Genetics, 2020). He is broadly interested in deep learning and other topics in machine learning and their applications to genomics and epigenetics. He is an avid (though amateur) chess player and puzzle solver in his free time.
