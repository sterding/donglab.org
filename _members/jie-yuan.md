Jie Yuan was an Associate Research Scientist in Dr. Dong’s lab, performing computational genomics research for Parkinson’s and neurological diseases. Jie completed his PhD in computer science at Columbia University working on statistical tools for GWAS analysis, including methods to identify disease subtypes with unique SNP associations (Yuan et al. *Nature Genetics*, 2018; Yuan et al. *PLoS Genetics*, 2020). He joined Dr Dong's lab at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School as a postdoc fellow in 2021. He is broadly interested in deep learning and other topics in machine learning and their applications to genomics and epigenetics. He is an avid (though amateur) chess player and puzzle solver in his free time.
