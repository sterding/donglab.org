Weiqiang Liu is a post-doctoral research fellow in Dr. Dongâ€™s lab in the Department of Neurology at Yale School of Medicine, Yale University. His current research interests focus on investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of chronic pain in human dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and trigeminal ganglia (TG) using multi-omics analysis. Weiqiang received his Ph.D. in Ecology from the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (2018-2024). During his Ph.D. training, his main work involved using comparative transcriptomics and evolutionary genomics to explore how animals can have roughly similar sequences yet vastly different lifespans (*EMBO Journal*, 2023; *Nature Communications*, 2023). In his spare time, he enjoys playing Ping Pong and running.
