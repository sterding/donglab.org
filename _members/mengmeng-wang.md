Mengmeng Wang is currently a master's student in the Computational Biology and Biomedical Informatics (CBB) program at Yale University. She holds a First Class Honours Bachelor of Science in Bioinformatics from Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University and the University of Liverpool.

Inspired by the unsolved mysteries of complex biological systems, Mengmeng chose bioinformatics as her field. She believes that cutting-edge computational methods and mindsets are key to unlocking new solutions for genetic challenges in neuroscience and brain science. In the Dong Lab, her work focuses on the genomics of Parkinson's disease.

Her interdisciplinary interests in neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy further enhance her ability to gain a deeper understanding of brain disorders. Outside of her academic pursuits, she enjoys listening to R&B music, traveling to natural and cultural sites, and long-distance running.
