Ariela Buxbaum Grice did a short-term reserach trainee in the lab after she graduated from Connecticut College, where she majored in biological sciences, with a minor concentration in studio art. She had worked in neuropsychiatric research labs, including labs at UCSD and Mount Sinai, primarily working in the area of molecular genetics. She was interested in working with “big data”– particularly differential expression analyses for neuropsychiatric disorders.
