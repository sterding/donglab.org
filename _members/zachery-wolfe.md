Zach Wolfe is a postdoctoral researcher in the Dong Lab, starting from Nov 2025. He received his Ph.D. in 2022 from the Department of Entomology at Purdue University with a thesis on the relationship between insecticide resistance and the gut microbiome in insect pests. He previously worked as a postdoctoral researcher in the laboratory of [Dr. Adam Norris](https://www.thenorrislab.org) at University of California, Riverside where he studied alternative RNA splicing and RNA circularization in neurons of *C. elegans*. His current research interests include alternative splicing, the biogenesis and impact of circRNAs and non-coding RNAs, and the broader implications of transcriptional regulation on neurological disorders. In his free time, Zach likes to explore the outdoors, watch football, and play chess.
