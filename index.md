# WHERE COMPUTER GEEKS HAVE A CRUSH ON THE HUMAN GENOME

The Dong Lab is a team of researchers at Harvard Medical School (soon will move to Yale School of Medicine) dedicated to answering important questions in genome biology and neurology with computation. We focus on studying transcriptional regulation and non-coding RNAs and their roles in neurodegenerative diseases through developing computational methods to integrate and analyze multi-omics and clinical data.

### Our Research
We study (1) **transcriptional regulation**, incl. discovery of regulatory elements in the human genome and how they contribute to gene expression; (2) **non-coding RNAs** (such as eRNA, circRNA, piRNA, miRNA) and their role in neurological diseases; and (3) **AI in precision medicine** by integrating multi-model data (e.g. omics, clinical, imaging, and wearable device) and the latest machine learning methods to predict disease diagnosis and progression.

### Our Projects
We live on collaboration. In most time, we talk to the front-end doctors or biologists and understand their questions. We use public-available datasets or generate our own data. We develop computational methods or tools to solve the problem (hopefully) and very often we enjoy the fun of new discovery together.

### Our Team
We are a team of enthusiastic researchers that enjoy the marriage of genome research and data science. We strive to build a learning environment for interdisciplinary research, and recognize the value of diversity in the process of discovery.
