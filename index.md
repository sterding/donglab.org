# WHERE COMPUTER GEEKS HAVE A CRUSH ON THE HUMAN GENOME

The Dong Lab is a team of researchers at Yale University dedicated to answering important questions in genome biology and brain diseases with both computational and experimental methods. We focus on studying transcriptional regulation and non-coding RNAs and their roles in neurodegenerative diseases through developing computational methods to integrate and analyze multi-omics and clinical data.

## Highlights



{% capture text %}
We study (1) **transcriptional regulation**, incl. discovery of regulatory elements in the human genome and how they contribute to gene expression; (2) **non-coding RNAs** (such as eRNA, circRNA, piRNA, miRNA) and their role in neurological diseases; and (3) **AI in precision medicine** by integrating multi-model data (e.g. omics, clinical, imaging, and wearable device) and the latest machine learning methods to predict disease diagnosis and progression.

We live on collaboration. In most time, we talk to the front-end doctors or biologists and understand their questions. We use public-available datasets or generate our own data. We develop computational methods or tools to solve the problem (hopefully) and very often we enjoy the fun of new discovery together.
