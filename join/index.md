# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-handshake-angle" %}Join the Team

We are always seeking talented and passionate people to join our team, from summer students to postdocs to staff scientists, short-term and long-term. You can learn a bit about working in the lab by reading our [onboarding](https://github.com/thedonglab/onboarding/blob/master/onboarding.md) document. **Note that we will move to Yale Univeristy from July 1st, 2024**. We stopped hiring for our current Harvard site during the transition. We welcome applications for our Yale site, including postdoc and research scientist. 

### Postdoctoral Researchers

The Dong Lab welcomes applications for both computational and experimental postdoctoral positions at Yale School of Medicine to work on our [projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects). In general, we ask you to send your CV, a cover letter to state your career goal, your research interest, and why you think you are a good fit for the lab, together with the contact information (name, affiliation, email, phone, your relationship) of three references. 
Learn about these opportunities through our recent Post-Doctoral Fellow posting at the [Yale Postdoctoral Positions website](https://postdocs.yale.edu/yale-postdoctoral-positions). Below are general job description for postdoc positions:

#### Postdoc in Computational Genomics
Do you have a computational background and a strong interest in genomics? Do you like to work on big multi-omics data to find cure or early biomarkers for human brain diseases? If your answer is YES to either question, we have a position for you. In Dong Lab, I'd like to work with you to support your career development by providing opportunity joining large-scale brain disease consortium, accessing the fresh datasets from the advanced sequencing technologies, immersive team environment with computational support, and growth plan to independance. We have several projects with well funded 

We will develop midbrain organoids from iPSC derived from healthy controls and neurodegenerative disease patients, and measure the time-series transcriptome and proteomics of extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted along with the differentiation. Single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq will also be conducted for the generated organoids. Meanwhile, we will apply a high-throughput 3D mini-brain platform to capture the organoidâ€™s electrophysiology signals in a real-time manner. The work is based on our recent publications (e.g., Dong et al., Nature Neuroscience, 2018; Chen et al. Nature Methods, 2021). We are looking for someone with experience in bulk or single-cell RNA-seq data analysis, and multi-omics data integration. Skills in high-dimensional data visualization or time-series data modelling is a plus.

This Research Scientist position will be offered a competitive salary and benefits, and expected to provide computational genomics support and service to the lab members and faculty in the local community. As a full-time employee in the well-funded Dong Lab and Adam Center for Parkinson's disease, the candidate will work with the director to develop bioinformatics pipelines for NGS data (e.g., bulk tissue and single-cell RNAseq, ATAC-seq, WGS/WES, ChIP-seq, Hi-C, etc.), provide both standard and customized data analysis service and bioinformatics training to the community. Experience in processing raw FASTQ files is required. Fluent programming in R, Linux bash, and one of the other languages (Python, Perl, C/C++, Matlab, or Java) is required. Experience in workflow/pipeline construction (e.g., Nextflow, Snakemake, CWL/WDL), cloud computing (e.g. AWS, GCP), Docker, or Conda is a plus. Ability to generate high-quality reports, communicate with clients effectively, good time management are key characteristics for an ideal candidate.

### Graduate Students

The Yale University has both an umbrella program and discipline-specific ones.
The umbrella program is the [Biological and Biomedical Sciences (BBS)](https://medicine.yale.edu/bbs/).
Our primary program affiliation is the Yale University's [Computational Biology and Biomedical informatics](https://cbb.yale.edu).
We are also excited to welcome students who want to pursue computational research from [other graduate programs](https://www.yale.edu/admissions/graduate-professional-schools) on a case-by-case basis.

Our goal is to help our students develop both a deep familiarity with the computational methods required for data-intensive science and a strong understanding of one or more biological application areas.
We provide training in all aspects through group meetings, individual meetings, and a supportive lab environment.

If you have not yet joined one of the PhD programs above, the first step to joining our group is to apply and be admitted to one of these programs.
If you are already a PhD student in one of the above programs and are interested in rotating in our lab, please [contact Dr Dong]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact) to set up a time to discuss your interest.


<!-- ### Programmers

We work with programmers at [BIDS's bioinformatics engineering team](https://cu-dbmi.github.io/set-website/) to bring research products to practice.
Visit their website to learn about opportunities on the team.

### Undergraduate Students

We welcome undergraduate students into our lab.
Undergraduate researchers have become first authors on papers submitted on research that they performed as part of our group.
We are happy to train undergraduates in many aspects of data-intensive biology, and we have high expectations for their level of commitment to research.

If you are an undergraduate interested in discussing research opportunities please [contact Dr Dong]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact).
