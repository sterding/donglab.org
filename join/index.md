# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-handshake-angle" %}Join the Team

We are always seeking talented and passionate people to join our team, from summer students to postdocs to staff scientists, short-term and long-term. **Note that we will move to Yale Univeristy from July 1st, 2024**. We stopped hiring for our current Harvard site during the transition. We welcome applications for our Yale site, including postdoc and research scientist. 

### Postdoctoral Researchers

The Dong Lab welcomes applications for both computational and experimental postdoctoral positions at Yale School of Medicine to work on our [projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects). In general, we ask you to send your CV, a cover letter to state your career goal, your research interest, and why you think you are a good fit for the lab, together with the contact information (name, affiliation, email, phone, your relationship) of three references. 
Learn about these opportunities through our recent Post-Doctoral Fellow posting at the [Yale Postdoctoral Positions website](https://postdocs.yale.edu/yale-postdoctoral-positions).

### Graduate Students

The Yale University has both an umbrella program and discipline-specific ones.
The umbrella program is the [Biological and Biomedical Sciences (BBS)](https://medicine.yale.edu/bbs/).
Our primary program affiliation is the Yale University's [Computational Biology and Biomedical informatics](https://cbb.yale.edu).
We are also excited to welcome students who want to pursue computational research from [other graduate programs](https://www.yale.edu/admissions/graduate-professional-schools) on a case-by-case basis.

Our goal is to help our students develop both a deep familiarity with the computational methods required for data-intensive science and a strong understanding of one or more biological application areas.
We provide training in all aspects through group meetings, individual meetings, and a supportive lab environment.

If you have not yet joined one of the PhD programs above, the first step to joining our group is to apply and be admitted to one of these programs.
If you are already a PhD student in one of the above programs and are interested in rotating in our lab, please [contact Dr Dong]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact) to set up a time to discuss your interest.


<!-- ### Programmers

We work with programmers at [BIDS's bioinformatics engineering team](https://cu-dbmi.github.io/set-website/) to bring research products to practice.
Visit their website to learn about opportunities on the team.

### Undergraduate Students

We welcome undergraduate students into our lab.
Undergraduate researchers have become first authors on papers submitted on research that they performed as part of our group.
We are happy to train undergraduates in many aspects of data-intensive biology, and we have high expectations for their level of commitment to research.

If you are an undergraduate interested in discussing research opportunities please [contact Dr Dong]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact).
